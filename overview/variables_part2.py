# -- Variables --
#----------------
# Source code: original code tou wrote in computer
# Translation: convert source code into machine language
# Compilation: Translate code before runtime
# Run Time : period app take to excute the commands
# Interpreted : Code translated on the fly during execution
#----------------------------------

#python => dynamically typed language we can change the variable type during run Time
#c => statically typed language , you should identify variable type before compilation

#in programming language there are many reserved word you can't use in variable name like if, clss, while

x= 10

x="hello"

print(x)

help("keywords") #print the reerved words in python

#assign more than one variable at one line
a,b,c = 1,2,3

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
